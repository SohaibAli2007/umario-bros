#**Super Umario Bros- Super Umario Bros- An AP Computer Science A (AP Java) Final Project**

This game features a basic 2D Platforming level, and a boss once you reach the goalpost. Your goal is to defeat the boss by attacking it 3 times, while it has different "states"/features that make it harder to attack it.

Super Umario Bros. features programmed collisions, pipes, jumping mechanics, powerups, and a "level design editor" (which will be further explained)

The project was heavily inspired by a Java Tutorial Series on Youtube. I heavily recommend it, please try it out!

**"Level Design Editor"**
The code features a great way to design your own levels, making it easy and intuitive. All it takes is a pixelated brush on any paint program (I prefer Aseprite) and you're ready to go! Look at the code for more information regarding what color represents what block/item in the game. 

For example, drawing a BLACK pixel will cause a single ground/wall block to be placed, with the collisions of that ground/wall block already being programmed into the game. Easy, right?
